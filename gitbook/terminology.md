# ðŸ’¡ Terminology

### Blockchain

The chosen blockchain for the settlement is [Near Protocol](https://near.org). It has been chosen due to its sharded architecture, low transaction fees and fast settlement/block finalization.\
A blockchain is a public ledger and all transactions can be investigated in an [explorer](https://explorer.near.org/), however it is also possible to encrypt the data, that is processed during a transaction to prevent external investigation.

### Block

Blocks are produced by the blockchain in a nearly constant time at around one second. This is ensured by the blockchains design, because the computations done in a single block cannot exceed 1,000 [TeraGas](terminology.md#gas). A block contains information about which transactions have been processed.

### Addresses

Users and programs of the blockchain are represented via addresses. Such addresses on Near Protocol are human readable (unlike Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible blockchains, where an address is a base64 encoded 20 bytes hash). This makes it easier to identify users and programs. Addresses are often also referred to as wallets.

### Access Keys

An access key is used to sign transactions for a specific address. Every address can have an unlimited amount of access keys, that are connected to it. When creating a new address a single full access key is added to that address, which allows signing transactions. It is possible to add additional access keys to that address.\
There is a distinction between function-call access keys and full access keys. A full access key is basically a private key, that gives full access to an address. A function-call access key is limited to be only able to call specific functions on a Smart Contract. It also only has limited amount of Gas that can be used until it is fully depleted.

### Smart Contract

Programs that are executed on the blockchain are called Smart Contracts (SCs). A SC on Near Protocol can be deployed on any address, so there is no distinction between user addresses and program addresses. Every address and therefore every SC has a state, that can be altered by calling a function of that SC. SC function calls that can alter state are also called transactions.\
A transaction can also write log messages to the blockchain. If those log messages use a standardized format they are called events and can be more easily deserialized by programs that read blockchain data.\

The current RTP PoC is deployed on the address "[rtp\_staging\_v2.testnet](https://testnet.nearblocks.io/address/rtp\_staging\_v2.testnet)".

### Gas

Gas is the unit in which computational power required to execute a Smart Contract is measured. Gas is paid via the NEAR token which is the cryptocurrency, that secures the Near Protocol blockchain. NEAR has a monetary value, which makes executing SCs not free, but there is also the concept of "view functions", which are read-only functions, that cannot alter the SCs state and are free to execute.
