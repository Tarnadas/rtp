# âš™ Cloudflare Workers API

[Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) (CW) is an edge & serverless computing platform developed and hosted by Cloudflare at its distributed computing network. The serverless approach allows developers to not have to maintain their own servers. The underlying infrastructure does not need any maintenance and scaling on high traffic is done automatically.
