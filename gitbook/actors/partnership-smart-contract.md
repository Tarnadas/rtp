# ü§ù Partnership Smart Contract

A Partnership Smart Contract is deployed by the [FSC](factory-smart-contract.md) and can never be interacted with directly. Only the FSC has allowance to call functions of a PSC, which is enforced by code. There exist no [access keys](../terminology.md#access-keys) for a PSC.
