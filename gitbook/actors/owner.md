# ðŸ”‘ Owner

The holder of the [full access key](../terminology.md#access-keys) for the [Factory Smart Contract](factory-smart-contract.md) (FSC) is referred to as the owner. Only the owner can call functions of the FSC and therefore perform and settle trades. An owner could be implemented as an API that the Banks can interact with via a graphical user interface.

The implementation of an owner is not part of this PoC. The PoC only describes and implements the interaction between the blockchain and various off-chain systems.
